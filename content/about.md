Hey there, this is Abhiram aka xbr. I have graduated with a BCA degree from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/). I currently do independent security research, identifying vulnerabilities in mobile applications. Occasionally, I try to dissect malwares and also play CTFs with Team bi0s, No.1 ranked CTF team in India. 

Represented India at [GCC 2025](https://gcc.ac/), an international training program. Delivered a talk at [bi0s meetup](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bi0s-kochi_bi0smeetup-cybersecurity-meetup-activity-7376225790667141121-fVYu). Led a team that secured 3rd place at the Mobile Hacking Community CTF organized at DEFCON 33. 

Feel free to reach out for anything, find me on the below links.
