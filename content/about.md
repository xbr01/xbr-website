Hey there, this is Abhiram aka xbr. I have graduated with a BCA degree from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/). I currently do independent security research, identifying vulnerabilities in mobile applications. Occasionally, I try to dissect malwares and also play CTFs with Team bi0s, No.1 ranked CTF team in India. 

Feel free to reach out for anything, find me on the below links.
